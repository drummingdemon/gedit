Useful customizatoions for gedit, hope someone else will find it delightful as well!

# terminal.py
A customized version of the popular plugin, this version simply places the terminal screen to the left side instead of the bottom. The location of the plugin varies among distributions, under Ubuntu 14.04 LTS the default location for me was:

/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/gedit/plugins
